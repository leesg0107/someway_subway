# someway_subway
I used Streamlit for easy development, and implemented the A* algorithm to find the shortest path from the departure station to the arrival station.
you can check entire seoul subway station but there is some problems about subway map(i'm going to fix it) 

you just need 'A_algorithm_web.py' , run this file by 'streamlit run A_algorithm_web.py' enjoy~
+you can print whole subway map by running 'mapping_st.py' 

PS.i have to add entire time until you arrive to the arrival station, but i didn't add yet.
